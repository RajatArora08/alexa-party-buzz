The world quickly took notice as San Holo grew to over 250.000 SoundCloud followers. His single \\u2018We Rise\\u2019 came out on NestHQ (OWSLA) garnering Skrillex and Diplo\\u2019s support and amassing millions of plays on SoundCloud and Spotify.  In early 2015, the Victory EP came out on the Canadian label Monstercat, renowned for having one of the most engaged and digitally oriented audiences. The release was paired with an intense visual campaign produced by San\\u2019s own creative company and label bitbird. Together with an official remix for Tchami\\u2019s hit \\u2018After Life\\u2019, an Initiation Mix on BBC Radio One with Annie Nightingale, and a performance at Tomorrowland, San Holo transitioned from a big SoundCloud name to becoming a real force within the music industry.  Meanwhile the \\u2018Don\\u2019t Touch The Classics\\u2019 series was born, where San remixes classic 90\\u2019s and early 20\\u2019s hip-hop tracks, with the \\u2018Dr. Dre \\u2013 The Next Episode\\u2019 remix crossing the 85 million plays mark on YouTube.  From there, a series of innovative music videos were launched, with the release of IMISSU (Spinnin\\u2019), being accompanied by a \\u2018100% screen capture\\u2019 music video in which the struggles of an electronic music producer are portrayed. The video for the next single, Can\\u2019t Forget You (Spinnin\\u2019), portrayed the life of a fan-vlogger desperate to validate her love.  2016 will be all about establishing his name as house-hold name in the scene. The year was kickstarted with the release of \\u2018Alright\\u2019, a collaboration with Yellow Claw on OWSLA\\u2019s Worldwide Broadcast compilation, and an official remix for Yellow Claw & DJ Mustard\\u2019s single \\u2018In My Room\\u2019. His New Sky EP also just came out on Monstercat, featuring an intense video about the loss of a loved one for \\u2018They Just Haven\\u2019t Seen It\\u2019.  San recently just completed his New Sky Tour, a 27 date two month long tour through the first quarter of 2016 across North America highlighting plays at Ultra Music Festival and Coachella\\u2019s Do Lab.  Late 2016 saw San release his biggest single to date \\\"Light\\\" via his own record label and creative company bitbird. \\\"Light\\\" immediately became a worldwide success amassing millions of plays across all platforms scoring San's debut on the Billboard Dance/Electronic charts and firmly supplanting San Holo as an international name in the trap and bass world.  San Holo also founded bitbird, a creative company and record label, together with his team, as a platform for showcasing and developing inspiring art.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Dre - The Next Episode (San Holo Remix)\\r\\nPlays: 129,531,121\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets:\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

The musical dexterity of The Purple Ones - with 11 pieces on stage including a full horn section \\u2013 completely turns the concept of a Prince tribute band on its head, delivering Prince's material live onstage in a way that has to be experienced to be believed.  Not a typical tribute band with a Prince lookalike or impersonator, The Purple Ones bring audiences to their feet, night after night, by speaking Prince's musical language, energy, rhythm, creativity and of course ...a serious dose of unadulterated funk. The Purple Ones tap into that soulful artistry like none other.  The Purple Ones is a labor of love that was born in 2012 when Bay Area based bandleader and founder, Morty Okin (\\\"The New Morty Show\\u201d, co-founder of the Michael Jackson tribute \\\"Foreverland\\\" and Neil Diamond tribute \\\"Super Diamond\\\",) decided to focus all of his energy on building the greatest Prince tribute on the planet.  The Purple Ones have been selling out concert venues since their inception, growing a fan base over the years that includes long-time Prince devotees and newbies that are just discovering the icon. It is not uncommon for the band to be joined on stage by \\\"Honorary Purple Ones\\\" like celebrity \\\"Super Fan,\\\" comedienne Margaret Cho and members of the artist's extended musical family, including renowned percussionist (and brother of Sheila E.) Juan Escovedo who toured the world with Prince in the 80's.  The newest member of The Purple Ones is Prince's former Musical Director, bassist/guitarist and co-founder of Prince's \\\"New Power Generation,\\\" Levi Seacer Jr. (1986-1993) Levi is the only Prince band member to have played multiple instruments. Later, collaborating with Prince as a songwriter and Co-Producer on his projects. Now the lead guitarist and Musical Director of The Purple Ones, Seacer is determined to continue the musical legacy of his late friend and former band mate. He says one of the biggest keys to the authenticity is the 'controlled chaos\\\" that existed in Prince's world that allowed for extreme creativity, \\\"With Prince,\\\" Levi says, you tried everything. That's the biggest thing I learned from him over all those years. If it doesn't work you can always take it out, but if it does work...there's no limit.\\\"  It seems the sky is the limit for The Purple Ones. In the wake of Prince's untimely passing, this group of funky pros are more determined than ever to honor his past by playing his hits, B-sides and deep cuts live in a world class show that is, in the words of Prince himself, \\\"nothin' but a party!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Purple Ones LIVE\\r\\nPlays: 14,045\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFREE w/ RSVP FOR PRINCE FANS ++ THE PUBLIC!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets:\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

The musical dexterity of The Purple Ones -<BR> with 11 pieces on stage including a full horn section \\u2013 completely turns the concept of a Prince tribute band<BR> on its head, delivering Prince's material live onstage in a way that has to be experienced to be believed.<BR> <BR> Not a typical tribute band with a Prince lookalike or impersonator, The Purple Ones bring audiences<BR> to their feet, night after night, by speaking Prince's musical language, energy, rhythm, creativity and of course<BR> ...a serious dose of unadulterated funk. The Purple Ones tap into that soulful artistry like none other.<BR> <BR> The Purple Ones is a labor of love that was born in 2012 when Bay Area based bandleader and founder,<BR> Morty Okin (\\\"The New Morty Show\\u201d, co-founder of the Michael Jackson tribute \\\"Foreverland\\\" and Neil Diamond<BR> tribute \\\"Super Diamond\\\",) decided to focus all of his energy on building the greatest Prince tribute on the planet.<BR> <BR> The Purple Ones have been selling out concert venues since their inception, growing a fan base over the years<BR> that includes long-time Prince devotees and newbies that are just discovering the icon. It is not uncommon for the<BR> band to be joined on stage by \\\"Honorary Purple Ones\\\" like celebrity \\\"Super Fan,\\\" comedienne Margaret Cho<BR> and members of the artist's extended musical family, including renowned percussionist (and brother of Sheila E.)<BR> Juan Escovedo who toured the world with Prince in the 80's.<BR> <BR> The newest member of The Purple Ones is Prince's former Musical Director, bassist/guitarist and co-founder of<BR> Prince's \\\"New Power Generation,\\\" Levi Seacer Jr. (1986-1993) Levi is the only Prince band member to have<BR> played multiple instruments. Later, collaborating with Prince as a songwriter and Co-Producer on his projects.<BR> Now the lead guitarist and Musical Director of The Purple Ones, Seacer is determined to continue the musical<BR> legacy of his late friend and former band mate. He says one of the biggest keys to the authenticity is the<BR> 'controlled chaos\\\" that existed in Prince's world that allowed for extreme creativity,<BR> \\\"With Prince,\\\" Levi says, you tried everything. That's the biggest thing I learned from him over all those years.<BR> If it doesn't work you can always take it out, but if it does work...there's no limit.\\\"<BR> <BR> It seems the sky is the limit for The Purple Ones. In the wake of Prince's untimely passing, this group of funky pros are<BR> more determined than ever to honor his past by playing his hits, B-sides and deep cuts live in a world class show<BR> that is, in the words of Prince himself, \\\"nothin' but a party!\\u2019<\\/P>\\r\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><A HREF=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHJ5uMTi3Lg\\\" TARGET=\\\"_blank\\\" REL=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\"><IMG ALT=\\\"\\\" WIDTH=\\\"600\\\" SRC=\\\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2FBHJ5uMTi3Lg%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&sig=ADR2i78uukQwQMWfNBZAJYD3oh8gMUVrng\\\"><\\/IMG><\\/A><\\/P>\\r\\n<DIV STYLE=\\\"width: 40%; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\\\">The Purple Ones LIVE<\\/DIV>\\r\\n<DIV STYLE=\\\"width: 40%; text-align: right; float: right;\\\">Plays: 14,045<\\/DIV>\\r\\n<P><BR><\\/P>\\r\\n<DIV><BR><\\/DIV>\\r\\n<DIV><B>FREE w/ RSVP FOR PRINCE FANS ++ THE PUBLIC!<\\/B><\\/DIV>\\r\\n<DIV><BR><\\/DIV>\\r\\n<DIV><BR><\\/DIV>\\r\\n<DIV><BR><\\/DIV>\\r\\n<HR>\\r\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><SPAN CLASS=\\\"text_exposed_show\\\"><STRONG><BR>Tickets:<\\/STRONG>\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

On his three worldwide tours in support of Epigram, TAOR and the LYM campaign, he performed to many sold out crowds including Paris, New York, Chicago, Amsterdam, Berlin, Zurich, Munich, Copenhagen, Brussels, Red Rocks in Colorado and huge crowds at major festivals like Lollapalooza, Coachella, Lollapalooza South America, Austin City Limits, Ultra, Bonnaroo, BUKU, Electric Forest, Electric ZOO, Decadence, Rock En Seine, Sziget, Sonar, Dour, Glastonbury amongst many.  In 2016 he released his latest album Epigram followed by extended Epigram Deluxe release with remixes and unreleased instrumentals at the end of the year.

Upon graduating high school, Metro moved to Atlanta, to attend Morehouse College, dropping out following his first semester after, he found himself in the studio more than the classroom, crafting hits for artists like Future, Ludacris, Gucci Mane, and others. The first of those hits, the Billboard-charting \\u201cKarate Chop,\\u201d is the the result of what has since become a long-running, undeniable partnership with one of hip-hop\\u2019s biggest stars, Future. The two first began working together in 2012, churning out popular mixtape tracks like developing a relationship that led to Metro producing four songs from Future\\u2019s sophomore album, Honest \\u2013 \\u201cKarate Chop\\u201d was joined by fellow singles \\u201cHonest\\u201d and the Kanye West-featuring \\u201cI Won,\\u201d along with album bonus track \\u201cHow Can I Not.\\u201d More recently, Metro executive produced Future\\u2019s fan-favorite mixtape, MONSTER, as well as Future\\u2019s third solo album, DS2, on which he also contributed production to 11 of the album\\u2019s 13 tracks. DS2 debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart.Metro\\u2019s continued collaborations with Future are complemented by key contributions to projects from artists like Nicki Minaj (\\u201cWant Some More\\u201d from her now-platinum Pinkprint), Meek Mill (\\u201cCheck\\u201d and \\u201cJump Out The Face\\u201d from his chart-topping Dreams Worth More Than Money), Makonnen (his platinum debut single \\u201cTuesday\\u201d), and many others, including Travi$ Scott, with Metro producing five songs on the rapper\\u2019s forthcoming Epic Records debut, Rodeo.Despite all of this success, it\\u2019s the work that Metro has done building and solidifying his own brand that has proved most fruitful \\u2013 indeed, the producer\\u2019s \\u201cMetro Boomin Want Some More!\\u201d tag has become one of the best known in all of popular music. That charge has been led not only by solo projects, like Metro\\u2019s widely acclaimed debut mixtape, 19 & Boomin, with plans for new releases in the coming months, but also with his move into the live music and DJ space, as Metro continues to take his patented sound and high-impact, high-energy show on the road. Earlier this year, Metro joined Travi$ Scott and Young Thug on the road for the Rodeo Tour, and most recently with Chance The Rapper, for the rapper\\u2019s Family Matters Tour.As the accomplishments continue to stack, it\\u2019s safe to say that Metro has experienced more success at 21 than most do in a lifetime. Despite that success, Metro is working to find new and exciting ways to interact with his fans and engage new audiences, alike, working tirelessly towards his goal of becoming one of music\\u2019s most dominant names.

Upon graduating high school, Metro moved to Atlanta, to attend Morehouse College, dropping out following his first semester after, he found himself in the studio more than the classroom, crafting hits for artists like Future, Ludacris, Gucci Mane, and others. The first of those hits, the Billboard-charting \\u201cKarate Chop,\\u201d is the the result of what has since become a long-running, undeniable partnership with one of hip-hop\\u2019s biggest stars, Future. The two first began working together in 2012, churning out popular mixtape tracks like developing a relationship that led to Metro producing four songs from Future\\u2019s sophomore album, Honest \\u2013 \\u201cKarate Chop\\u201d was joined by fellow singles \\u201cHonest\\u201d and the Kanye West-featuring \\u201cI Won,\\u201d along with album bonus track \\u201cHow Can I Not.\\u201d More recently, Metro executive produced Future\\u2019s fan-favorite mixtape, MONSTER, as well as Future\\u2019s third solo album, DS2, on which he also contributed production to 11 of the album\\u2019s 13 tracks. DS2 debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart.<BR><BR>Metro\\u2019s continued collaborations with Future are complemented by key contributions to projects from artists like Nicki Minaj (\\u201cWant Some More\\u201d from her now-platinum Pinkprint), Meek Mill (\\u201cCheck\\u201d and \\u201cJump Out The Face\\u201d from his chart-topping Dreams Worth More Than Money), Makonnen (his platinum debut single \\u201cTuesday\\u201d), and many others, including Travi$ Scott, with Metro producing five songs on the rapper\\u2019s forthcoming Epic Records debut, Rodeo.<BR><BR>Despite all of this success, it\\u2019s the work that Metro has done building and solidifying his own brand that has proved most fruitful \\u2013 indeed, the producer\\u2019s \\u201cMetro Boomin Want Some More!\\u201d tag has become one of the best known in all of popular music. That charge has been led not only by solo projects, like Metro\\u2019s widely acclaimed debut mixtape, 19 &amp; Boomin, with plans for new releases in the coming months, but also with his move into the live music and DJ space, as Metro continues to take his patented sound and high-impact, high-energy show on the road. Earlier this year, Metro joined Travi$ Scott and Young Thug on the road for the Rodeo Tour, and most recently with Chance The Rapper, for the rapper\\u2019s Family Matters Tour.<BR><BR>As the accomplishments continue to stack, it\\u2019s safe to say that Metro has experienced more success at 21 than most do in a lifetime. Despite that success, Metro is working to find new and exciting ways to interact with his fans and engage new audiences, alike, working tirelessly towards his goal of becoming one of music\\u2019s most dominant names. Metro Boomin want some more, indeed.<\\/P>\\r\\n<P STYLE=\\\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\\\"><BR><\\/P>\\r\\n<DIV STYLE=\\\"width: 266.375px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\\\">Metro Boomin &amp; 21 Savage - X<\\/DIV>\\r\\n<DIV STYLE=\\\"width: 266.375px; text-align: right; float: right;\\\">Plays: 5,080,277<\\/DIV>\\r\\n<P STYLE=\\\"font-size: 18px;\\\"><BR><\\/P>\\r\\n<P STYLE=\\\"font-size: 18px;\\\"><BR><\\/P>\\r\\n<P STYLE=\\\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\\\"><SPAN CLASS=\\\"text_exposed_show\\\"><STRONG><BR>Tickets:<\\/STRONG>\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

You\\u2019ll suddenly pick up on the power and devastation lurking in its quietude, the doom hiding beneath its unvarnished beauty. You\\u2019ll hear the way it magnifies the intimacy at the heart of the North Carolina duo\\u2019s music, as if they created their own musical language as they recorded it.\\n\\u201cWe talked about the feel of each song and pointed out loosely who was going to be taking solos, but it was mostly a lot of fresh takes, a lot of eye contact, and a lot of nods and weird winks,\\u201d says Andrew Marlin, who anchors the band with fellow multi-instrumentalist and singer Emily Frantz.\\nReleased Sept. 30 on Yep Roc Records,\\u00a0Blindfaller\\u00a0builds on the acclaim of Mandolin Orange\\u2019s breakthrough debut on the label, 2013\\u2019s\\u00a0This Side of Jordan, and its follow-up, last year\\u2019s\\u00a0Such Jubilee.\\nSince then they\\u2019ve steadily picked up speed and fans they\\u2019ve earned from long stretches on the road, including appearances at Austin City Limits, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Pickathon. It\\u2019s been an auspicious journey for a pair who casually met at a bluegrass jam session in 2009.\\nAs the duo\\u2019s songwriter, Marlin sharpens his lyrical prowess here, touching on broad themes of growing older and feeling helpless in a world torn by injustice. Sure, the album sounds classic, but it is rooted in the here and now of our daily headlines.\\nTake \\u201cGospel Shoes,\\u201d a gimlet-eyed critique of how politicians have used faith as a weapon. \\u201cFreedom was a simple word, so reverent and true/ A long time ago, it meant the right to choose/ Who you love and how to live, but now it\\u2019s so misused/ And twisted by the politics of men in gospel shoes,\\u201d Marlin sings.\\n\\u201cWhen we finished \\u2018Such Jubilee,\\u2019 I started writing these songs with a different goal in mind. I thought about how I would write songs for somebody else to record,\\u201d Marlin explains. \\u201cI ended up with a bunch of songs like that, but we chose ones that I still felt personally connected to.\\u201d\\n\\u201cWe really chose everybody who played on the record, because we trusted them,\\u201d he adds.\\nThey found kindred spirits in Clint Mullican on bass, Kyle Keegan on drums, Allyn Love on pedal steel, and previous collaborator, Josh Oliver, on guitar, keys and vocals.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve always liked to record fairly live,\\u201d Frantz says, \\u201cand it\\u2019s pretty easy to do that when it\\u2019s just Andrew and me.\\u00a0So it was fun to hone in on the guys who played on this record.\\u201cWe really jelled as soon as we got into the studio, and everyone's playing was driven by intuition instead of details orchestrated in advance.\\u201d\\nHoled up at the Rubber Room studio in Chapel Hill, N.C., they laid down the tracks in a week between touring. They\\u2019ve always been keen on the notion that drawn-out recording sessions don\\u2019t necessarily yield better results. A good song, and just one good take, will always shine through any studio sorcery.\\nFor Frantz,\\u00a0Blindfaller, which Mandolin Orange produced, was something of a turning point.\\n\\u201cNow that we\\u2019ve put out quite a few records and toured so much, I think a standard has been set and people expect a certain thing,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBut you don\\u2019t want to get into a place where you\\u2019re just making the music you\\u2019re expected to make. You have to push yourself a little bit.\\u201d\\nThe passage of time, and the regret that often accompanies it, courses through these songs. \\u201cWhen did all the good times turn to hard lines on my face/ And lead me so far from my place right by your side?\\u201d Marlin ruminates on \\u201cMy Blinded Heart.\\u201d\\nIn fact, there\\u2019s heartache by the numbers on\\u00a0Blindfaller.

Straight out of a honky tonk, \\u201cHard Travelin\\u2019\\u201d lets the band shift into overdrive.

You\\u2019ll suddenly pick up on the power and devastation lurking in its quietude, the doom hiding beneath its unvarnished beauty. You\\u2019ll hear the way it magnifies the intimacy at the heart of the North Carolina duo\\u2019s music, as if they created their own musical language as they recorded it.<\\/P>\\n<P>\\u201cWe talked about the feel of each song and pointed out loosely who was going to be taking solos, but it was mostly a lot of fresh takes, a lot of eye contact, and a lot of nods and weird winks,\\u201d says Andrew Marlin, who anchors the band with fellow multi-instrumentalist and singer Emily Frantz.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Released Sept. 30 on Yep Roc Records,\\u00a0<EM>Blindfaller<\\/EM>\\u00a0builds on the acclaim of Mandolin Orange\\u2019s breakthrough debut on the label, 2013\\u2019s\\u00a0<EM>This Side of Jordan<\\/EM>, and its follow-up, last year\\u2019s\\u00a0<EM>Such Jubilee<\\/EM>.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Since then they\\u2019ve steadily picked up speed and fans they\\u2019ve earned from long stretches on the road, including appearances at Austin City Limits, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Pickathon. It\\u2019s been an auspicious journey for a pair who casually met at a bluegrass jam session in 2009.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">As the duo\\u2019s songwriter, Marlin sharpens his lyrical prowess here, touching on broad themes of growing older and feeling helpless in a world torn by injustice. Sure, the album sounds classic, but it is rooted in the here and now of our daily headlines.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Take \\u201cGospel Shoes,\\u201d a gimlet-eyed critique of how politicians have used faith as a weapon. \\u201cFreedom was a simple word, so reverent and true/ A long time ago, it meant the right to choose/ Who you love and how to live, but now it\\u2019s so misused/ And twisted by the politics of men in gospel shoes,\\u201d Marlin sings.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\u201cWhen we finished \\u2018Such Jubilee,\\u2019 I started writing these songs with a different goal in mind. I thought about how I would write songs for somebody else to record,\\u201d Marlin explains. \\u201cI ended up with a bunch of songs like that, but we chose ones that I still felt personally connected to.\\u201d<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\u201cWe really chose everybody who played on the record, because we trusted them,\\u201d he adds.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">They found kindred spirits in Clint Mullican on bass, Kyle Keegan on drums, Allyn Love on pedal steel, and previous collaborator, Josh Oliver, on guitar, keys and vocals.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\u201cWe\\u2019ve always liked to record fairly live,\\u201d Frantz says, \\u201cand it\\u2019s pretty easy to do that when it\\u2019s just Andrew and me.\\u00a0So it was fun to hone in on the guys who played on this record.\\u201cWe really jelled as soon as we got into the studio, and everyone's playing was driven by intuition instead of details orchestrated in advance.\\u201d<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Holed up at the Rubber Room studio in Chapel Hill, N.C., they laid down the tracks in a week between touring. They\\u2019ve always been keen on the notion that drawn-out recording sessions don\\u2019t necessarily yield better results. A good song, and just one good take, will always shine through any studio sorcery.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">For Frantz,\\u00a0<EM>Blindfaller<\\/EM>, which Mandolin Orange produced, was something of a turning point.<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\u201cNow that we\\u2019ve put out quite a few records and toured so much, I think a standard has been set and people expect a certain thing,\\u201d she says. \\u201cBut you don\\u2019t want to get into a place where you\\u2019re just making the music you\\u2019re expected to make. You have to push yourself a little bit.\\u201d<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">The passage of time, and the regret that often accompanies it, courses through these songs. \\u201cWhen did all the good times turn to hard lines on my face/ And lead me so far from my place right by your side?\\u201d Marlin ruminates on \\u201cMy Blinded Heart.\\u201d<\\/P>\\n<P STYLE=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">In fact, there\\u2019s heartache by the numbers on\\u00a0<EM>Blindfaller<\\/EM>. If you didn\\u2019t know better, you\\u2019d swear \\u201cPicking Up Pieces\\u201d is a tearjerker George Jones or Willie Nelson sang back in the early 1970s.

The Portland rapper's single \\\"Caroline\\\" has dominated both the airwaves and the internet for the past 6 months---racking up over 200 MILLION streams since it came out. The music video, which Amine directed himself, has won over the internet with its unabashed playfulness + subtle homages to past Tarantino & Wes Anderson flicks. It's also just the beginning. Amine has a lot more surprises up his sleeve for Portland, hip-hop, and the world at large.   You don't ever think of a rapper or even a black guy coming out of Portland, he asserts. That's just not a thing! However, there's a fairly diverse subculture in the city that few people know about. It's very different from what you would expect.   However, everything he does defies expectations. The rapper, artist, and director draws equal influence from his parents Ethiopian heritage as he does from trailblazers such as Kanye West and Andre 3000. He's more likely to record in a remote AirBNB'ed wilderness cabin than he is in a posh studio, and he cites Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson as major inspirations. Building on a lifelong passion for music, he began recording in high school and quietly sharpening his mic skills. While attending Portland State University, he released his 2015 project Calling Brio. Merging visual lyricism, swaggering production, and his clever, catchy bars, it became a phenomenon on Soundcloud, racking up over 1 million+ plays. In addition to praise from Pigeons & Planes, HypeTrak, and more, Complex spotlighted him as one of the artists we're certainly checking for this year.   I'm a fan of all genres, he explains. My parents always played African music and Bob Marley. Then, I grew up on everything from Erykah Badu to John Mayer. I want to do something that reflects this diversity. My songs need to be good for the listener personally.   Representing that mosaic style, his 2016 single \\\"CAROLINE\\\" struts through a funked-up tribal bounce with the kind of grit and gusto that'd make Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega proud. Upon release, it quickly caught fire, garnering 34 million-plus Spotify streams, 20 million-plus Soundcloud plays, and 16 million-plus YouTube/VEVO views as well as reaching #1 on Spotify's Global Viral Top 50, #1 on the US Viral Top 50, and #1 on the Canada Viral Top 50. As the track took off, he inked a deal with Republic Records. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmin\\u00e9 - Caroline\\r\\nPlays: 110,458,323\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets:\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

Fluttert began to make music at the age of 18 when he studied at the University of Utrecht and discovered deep house. Quickly learning DJ'ing and production techniques, he released two tracks in 2012 (\\\"Zomer\\\" and the Martin Luther King-sampling \\\"Vandaag\\\") and soon came to the attention of several electronic music labels. He signed to the dance agency Soulmax shortly afterward. In 2013, he put out the Uitzicht EP on Soundplate Records. The track hit a few European singles charts, but when Sony-affiliated B1 Recordings re-released \\\"Vandaag\\\" as \\\"One Day (Vandaag)\\\" in 2014, it became a massive hit, reaching the Top 5 in several countries (including the top spot in France) and propelling him to further acclaim. High-profile DJ gigs followed, and his melodic, jazz-influenced house music attracted large crowds and led to him performing at the EDM festival Tomorrowland. That same year, Dutch label Deep Soul released Bakermat's gospel-inspired \\\"Teach Me\\\" single, which was remixed by Detroit-born house legend MK (Marc Kinchen). \\\"Games,\\\" a more pop-oriented single featuring vocalist Marie Plassard, followed in early 2016. \\r\\n\\r\\nBakermat - One Day (Vandaag)\\r\\nPlays: 16,260,131\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets:\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

Born Joseph Junior Adenuga to Nigerian parents, Skepta moved to Tottenham with his family at the age of three. Inspired by both U.S. and U.K. hip-hop, he started his music career appearing on the pirate radio circuit and performing at various MC battles. In 2005, he formed the grime label Boy Better Know with brother J.M.E. and Wiley, and a year later joined East London collective Roll Deep, although he left the following year to concentrate on Boy Better Know and his solo career. He released his first two albums, Greatest Hits and Microphone Champion, through his label before signing with All Around the World Records in 2010. In the same year, he reached the Top 40 with \\\"Bad Boy\\\" (number 26) and \\\"Rescue Me\\\" (number 14), supported Chipmunk on his U.K. tour, and was personally selected by P. Diddy to record a grime remix of \\\"Hello Good Morning\\\" after being recommended by his Twitter followers. His third album, Doin' It Again, featuring the Top 40-charting single \\\"Cross My Heart,\\\" was released at the beginning of 2011, subsequently peaking at number 19 on the U.K. album chart.   In 2012, Skepta released two singles (\\\"Hold On\\\" and the C+C Music Factory-sampling \\\"Make Peace Not War\\\") that took his sound in a more commercially minded direction. Both songs hit the Top 30 of the U.K. singles chart, and were intended to be the leadoff singles to an album titled The Honeymoon, but the disappointing reaction from fans led to the album being scrapped, and a mixtape titled Blacklisted was released at the end of the year in its place. After keeping a low profile in 2013, Skepta came back in a big way the following year. He contributed a verse to a remix of \\\"German Whip\\\" by Meridian Dan, which became a Top 20 hit in May 2014. The following month, Skepta's single \\\"That's Not Me\\\" (which featured a guest verse by J.M.E.) was released, hitting number 21 on the charts. Both tracks were praised as helping to revitalize grime, and the latter was eventually named track of the year by FACT Magazine. Skepta's early 2015 single \\\"Shutdown\\\" was another U.K. Top 40 hit, and the MC received attention from Drake and Kanye West, joining the latter on-stage during the BRIT Awards. Skepta made his acting debut with a role in the 2015 crime drama Anti-Social, and worked on his long-delayed album Konnichiwa. The album was finally released by Boy Better Know in May of 2016, featuring guest appearances from Wiley, Pharrell Williams, and Novelist, in addition to his previous two hit singles. It debuted at number two on the British charts and earned vast critical acclaim, including the prestigious Mercury Prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkepta - Shutdown\\r\\nPlays: 43,400,312\\r\\n\\r\\nTickets:\\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

Will explains \\u201cPlaying in Ibiza felt natural straight away. I get on and work well there, it fits, it\\u2019s my second home.\\u201d\\r\\nCutting into the DJ circuit is no mean feat, but the cream rises to the top, so whilst Will is busy DJing at an ever growing list of clubs he\\u2019s also getting prestigious gigs at clubs like Space and MOS. Along side these gigs Will has also be building his own club brand Cut a Rug. Holding regular parties at Motion in Bristol Cut A Rug have hosted the likes of Visionquest, Carl Cox, Boys Noize, Zombie Disco Squad and Hauswerks, with whom Will has been able to support on the decks, a job which is natural to him. Outside of the UK Will has been booked for his debut Australian tour towards the end of the summer. Along with trips back and fourth to NYC and not forgetting Ibiza during this summer.\\r\\nYet whilst DJing and promotion have been building well for Will, his real strengths lie in the studio. Having been committed to his studio for many years he also undertook a music production course that have seen him made rapid progress in a short time with releases on labels such as Anabatic, Exploited, Southern Fried, No Brainer along with the launch of his new label Cut A Rug. Some of Will\\u2019s recent releases has had support from the likes of Jamie Jones, Mista Jam, Hannah Wants with plays on Radio 1 and Radio 1 Xtra.\\r\\nTalking of his approach to productions Will says \\u201cI make music for clobbers, not DJs.
